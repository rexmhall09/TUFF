# Verifies that the version the Mac app shows has not fallen behind the
# published GitHub releases.
#
# Most users build from a clone, where there is no Info.plist, so the compiled
# constant in AboutPanelPresentation is the version they see. Nothing bumps it
# automatically, so without this check it silently ages: the About panel would
# claim an old version on a current checkout.
#
# The release flow is: merge work, tag main, then merge a follow-up PR that
# bumps the constant. Between the tag and that follow-up, the constant is one
# release behind on purpose, so exactly one release of lag is allowed. Two or
# more means the bump was forgotten. Being ahead is allowed too, which is the
# state after the bump merges and before the next tag.
