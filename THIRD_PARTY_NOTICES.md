# Third-party software and model terms

TUFF repository source is licensed under the
[Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). That license applies to TUFF's own source
and documentation. It does not relicense model weights or third-party
packages.

This file records the dependency review updated on 2026-08-26. It is an
attribution aid, not legal advice. Anyone distributing a compiled product must
also preserve the license and NOTICE material required by the exact dependency
versions included in that product.

## Model weights

Model weights are not included in this repository. The installer downloads
the pinned revision
`0d77464eeb233a2da68ebf9d7dc4edaac7db956d` of
[`mlx-community/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit`](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit)
and repacks it locally. Its model card describes it as an Apache-2.0
quantization of Google's Gemma 4 26B-A4B instruction checkpoint.
Google publishes Gemma 4 under the
[Apache License 2.0](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/apache_2).

Downloaded weights remain a separate work governed by their source terms. Do
not redistribute weights as part of TUFF releases.
